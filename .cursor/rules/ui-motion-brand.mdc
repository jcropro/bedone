# Tokens & Theming
- Use **Ember tokens** for colors/typography/elevation/motion (Palette/Tokens.kt).
- Support: Dark/Light/True Black/Dynamic color; Reduced Motion path.
- Spacing on 4/8dp grid; 48dp min touch; 24dp icons; AA contrast minimum.

# Motion
- Default durations: taps 120–220ms; transitions ≤ 400ms.
- Curves: fast-out-slow-in for transitions; spring for micro-interactions.
- Reduced Motion: swap springs → fades; no parallax.

# UI States
- Implement loading/empty/error/disabled/selected.
- TalkBack labels and state announcements for interactive elements.
