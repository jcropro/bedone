# Repository Overview

This project implements the Ember audio player experience with a focus on the sleep timer drawer flow and Material 3 theming.

## Current Mandate
- Keep the Android build green by running the preflight and Gradle gates outlined in `AGENTS.md`.
- Continue developing the application features described in `docs/NEXT.md`, prioritising the sleep timer experience, audio effect refactors, and onboarding scenes.

## Key Documents
- `docs/MASTER_PROMPT.md` — operational runbook.
- `docs/STATE.yml` — latest build metadata and workstream status.
- `docs/NEXT.md` — the current top three development priorities.
